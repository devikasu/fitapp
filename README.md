Project Description Taking care of the virtual character by your steps .The more you walk the more food your character gets , but if you don't walk enough the character dies . For the hackathon instead of setting a daily goal we created an evaluating button which checks whether the desired goal is achieved or not showcasing the character 's different motions.

The Problem statement Walking is the simplest form of exercise. People do make long term commitments on completing this amount of steps but give up due to lack of everday motivation. The Solution In our webapp , the user has to walk in order to feed their virtual pet. This sense of seeing their virtual pet happy creates an urge to feed it more,to walk more.
